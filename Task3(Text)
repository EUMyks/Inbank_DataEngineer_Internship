What are the major differences between ETL and ELT approaches to data 
transformation?

ETL can be used in near real time cases, using a temporary storage space before transforming data and loading it into the target machine. It doesn't save history and is quite inflexible. 

ELT allows for more modifications in data structure and queries with loading data into a permanent storage base before applying logic to it.
This is the newer structure that allows for smarter use of cloud storage and computing


 What are the major differences between data analytics and data engineering?
 
 One is focused on getting information out of data to make decisions.
 Data engineer is focused on doing the groundwork for data analysist - building the database structures and flows.
 
Is there any specific software/tool/technology you are really interested in working with?

I really like shaving time off processes and I know little of ELT tools. Thus getting to learn and use them would be a really exiting experience. 
I liked the exercises given here, however I wish they were a harder and provided a challange. :D
